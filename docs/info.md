## How it works

3 logic gates (OR, NAND, XOR) are connecgted between input switches and output display to check function.

## How to test

Toggle the input swtiches to see how the output of the logic gate react.

OR Gate
  Switch 1 & 2 -> OR gate inputs
  Output [0] -> OR gate output

  NAND
    Switch 3 & 4 -> NAND gate inputs
    Ouput [2] -> NAND gate output

  XOR
    Switch 7 & 8 -> XOR gate inputs
    Output {7} -> XOR gate output

## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
